# Name
The official name of the company, as incorporated in the Kingdom of Norway, is Revontulet AS.

In daily use, the company may be referred to simply as Revontulet.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Please note that the word "Intelligence," despite being featured in the logo and online accounts, is not a part of the company's official name. The inclusion of "Intelligence" as a sub-title is intended to clarify the activities and offerings of the company and to distinguish it from other uses of the word Revontulet.
 
## The Story of the Name
Revontulet  is Finnish for “northern lights” and translates to “fox fire.” In Finnish folklore, the aurora stems from the sparks of fur from an arctic fox running across the night sky.

The name also allows us to reflect on the qualities we embody: The aurora ties together the northern and southern hemispheres, bringing light to our darkest days and expanding across the horizon. Arctic foxes are clever, curious, and playful. While our work spans the globe, the Nordic name allows us to maintain a sense of our roots, from which our global reach and impact grow.
