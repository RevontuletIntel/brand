# Name

## The Story of the name
Revontulet  is Finnish for “northern lights” and translates to “fox fire.” In Finnish folklore, the aurora stems from the sparks of fur from an arctic fox running across the night sky.

The name also allows us to reflect on the qualities we embody: The aurora ties together the northern and southern hemispheres, bringing light to our darkest days and expanding across the horizon. Arctic foxes are clever, curious, and playful. While our work spans the globe, the Nordic name allows us to maintain a sense of our roots, from which our global reach and impact grow.
